# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Estrella  

**Mobile Developer | React Native & Expo | TypeScript | Product-Focused App Development**  
I build **real, user-centered mobile applications** focused on clarity, usability, and long-term maintainability.  
My work emphasizes **clean UI/UX, well-structured app architecture, and reliable data flows**, turning ideas into functional products people can actually use.

I learn best by **building and publishing real apps**, understanding how mobile products work end to end — from design decisions to implementation and iteration.

---

## 💼 What I Build

- 📱 **Mobile Applications** — Cross-platform apps using React Native & Expo  
- 🎨 **User Interfaces & UX** — Thoughtful UI design with Figma, focused on real user needs  
- 🔐 **App Logic & Auth** — Authentication, user flows, and permissions using Supabase  
- 🔄 **API & Data Integration** — Connecting mobile apps to backend services and databases  
- 🧠 **Product-Driven Solutions** — Apps designed around real problems, not just features  

> My product-oriented mindset helps me build mobile apps that are practical, usable, and aligned with real-world use cases.

## 💡 How I Work

```typescript
class PaulEstrella {
  role = "Mobile Developer";
  focus = "Product-Focused Mobile Applications";

  stack = {
    mobile: ["React Native", "Expo"],
    language: ["TypeScript"],
    backend: ["Supabase", "PostgreSQL"],
    web: ["Next.js"],
    design: ["Figma"],
    tools: ["Git", "GitHub", "Claude Code"]
  };

  values = [
    "Understanding the 'why' behind product decisions",
    "Clean and maintainable code",
    "Thoughtful user experience",
    "Building real apps, not just demos"
  ];

  approach = "Understand the problem → Design the experience → Build → Iterate";

  openToRemoteRoles() {
    return true;
  }
}
