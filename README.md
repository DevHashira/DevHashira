# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Estrella  

**Frontend Developer (Web & Mobile) | React • Next.js • React Native (Expo) | User-Focused Interfaces**

I build **modern, scalable user interfaces** for **web and mobile applications**, with a strong focus on **UX, performance, and maintainable frontends**.

My core strength is **frontend development**, working primarily with **React and Next.js for web** and **React Native with Expo for mobile**, building consistent experiences across platforms.

I have a solid understanding of **backend concepts** (APIs, authentication, databases), which allows me to collaborate effectively with backend teams and integrate frontend applications smoothly into real-world systems.

I learn best by **building complete products**, focusing on how users interact with interfaces and how frontend decisions impact usability, performance, and product quality.

## 💼 What I Build

- 🎨 **User Interfaces (Web & Mobile)** — Clean, responsive, and accessible UIs  
- 📱 **Mobile Applications** — Cross-platform apps with React Native & Expo  
- 🌐 **Web Applications** — Frontend apps using React & Next.js  
- 🔗 **API Integration** — Consuming REST APIs and backend services  
- 🧠 **UX-Focused Development** — Translating designs into usable interfaces  
- 🧩 **Component-Based Systems** — Reusable, scalable UI components  

> I focus on frontend systems that are predictable, user-friendly, and easy to evolve over time.

## 💡 How I Work

```ts
class PaulEstrella {
  role = "Frontend Developer (Web & Mobile)"
  focus = "User-Focused Interfaces"

  stack = {
    web: ["React", "Next.js", "TypeScript", "Tailwind CSS"],
    mobile: ["React Native", "Expo"],
    backendIntegration: ["Supabase", "PostgreSQL", "REST APIs"],
    design: ["Figma"],
    tools: ["Git", "GitHub", "Docker", "Claude Code"]
  }

  values = [
    "Clear and intuitive user experiences",
    "Clean, maintainable frontend code",
    "Design-to-code consistency",
    "Collaboration with backend teams"
  ]

  frontend_focus = "80%"
  backend_understanding = "20%"

  approach = "Design → Build → Test → Iterate"
