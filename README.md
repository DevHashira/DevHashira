# 👋 Hi, I'm Paul Estrella  

**Backend Developer | Python · Django · REST APIs**  
I build **reliable, well-structured backend systems** that power real-world applications.  
My focus is on **clean backend architecture, API design, and solid data modeling**, with an emphasis on maintainability and long-term scalability.

I learn best by **building real projects**, understanding how backend systems support products end to end: from business logic and database design to API development.

---

## 💼 What I Build

- ⚙️ **Backend Systems** — REST APIs using Django  
- 🔐 **Application Logic** — Authentication, permissions, and business rules  
- 🗄️ **Databases** — Relational data modeling with PostgreSQL  
- 🔄 **API Integration** — Backend services that support web and mobile clients  
- 🧠 **Problem-Driven Solutions** — Backend-first thinking to solve real problems  

> My background in product and mobile development helps me design backends that are practical, usable, and aligned with real product needs.

## 💡 How I Work

```python
class PaulEstrella:
    role = "Backend Developer"
    focus = "Backend Foundations & API Design"

    stack = {
        "language": "Python",
        "framework": "Django",
        "apis": "REST",
        "database": "PostgreSQL",
        "devops": ["Docker (basic)", "AWS (basic)"],
        "tools": ["Git", "GitHub", "Claude Code"]
    }

    values = [
        "Understanding the 'why' behind technical decisions",
        "Clean and maintainable code",
        "Well-structured data models",
        "Continuous learning through real projects"
    ]

    approach = "Understand the problem → Design the backend → Build → Improve"

    def open_to_remote_roles(self):
        return True
