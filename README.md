## 💼 About Me

I’m a Flutter Developer focused on building mobile applications that improve people's lives.  
Currently, I specialize in creating solutions using **Flutter (Dart)** for frontends and **FastAPI (Python)** for backend services, especially when AI and emotional intelligence features are required.

My projects aim to integrate **user-centered design**, **automation**, and **predictive technologies** in a meaningful way — especially in educational and emotional health contexts.

I recently completed a bootcamp in **Data Science & Machine Learning**, and I've built AI-integrated projects like **EmotiNest**, a platform for tracking and predicting emotional states in children.
